# Playframework form examples

### Play 2.4 project (you'll need java 8 to run it on your local machine)

An explanatory [blog post] can be found here. But if you're coming to this 
repository from that blog post already, you'll want to clone this repo and 
then do `sbt run` to see the examples. There's an index page at `/` that 
you'll be able to use to navigate and interact with the examples.
